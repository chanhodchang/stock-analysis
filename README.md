Using VBA to analyze stock
### Challenge
In this analysis, I used VBA to make a quick analysis of a couple of stocks. I first made a macro to analyze the DQ stock and used the 2018 worksheet to find the Total Daily Volume and Return of DQ in 2018. 

After I made an analysis of all the stocks from either 2017 and 2018 workesheet. I was able to do this by using an input box to add a year value so the macro could run for either worksheet. 

I then analyzed all 12 stocks and finding the Total Daily Volume, Starting Price, Ending Price, and Return. I then formatted the headers to give it a bold text and underline to make it easier to differentiate between the headers and the data. I also formatted the returns data to code positive returns as green and negative as red so it could be easier to analyze.

Lastly, I refactored the macro so it would be easier to improve the functionality of the code.
